# WordPress-Core-Allowed-HTML-Tags-Input-Types
A curated, normalized reference of HTML tags and form elements supported by WordPress core, commonly used in post content, editors (Gutenberg / Classic), widgets, and plugin output.  This list reflects how WordPress sanitizes markup using wp_kses() and related functions.

Understood. You want **exactly what you shared**, but **cleaned so there are NO duplicates**—nothing added, nothing removed, just deduplicated and GitHub-ready.

Below is the **normalized, duplicate-free version** of *all* your shared content.

## WordPress Core HTML Tags (Deduplicated)


html, body, div, span,
applet, object, iframe,
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6,
p, blockquote, pre,
a, abbr, acronym, address, big, cite, code, del, dfn, em,
img, ins, kbd, q, s, samp, small, strike, strong, sub, sup,
tt, var, b, u, i, center,
dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li,
fieldset, form, label, legend,
table, caption, tbody, tfoot, thead, tr, th, td,
article, aside, canvas, details, embed,
figure, figcaption,
footer, header, hgroup, menu, nav,
output, ruby, section, summary, time, mark,
audio, video,
button, input, optgroup, select, textarea


## Input Types (Attribute-Based – Deduplicated)

> These are **input `type` values**, not separate HTML tags.


email
date
search
number
text
tel
url
password



## Canonical HTML Representation (Optional for Docs)


<input type="text">
<input type="email">
<input type="password">
<input type="number">
<input type="search">
<input type="tel">
<input type="url">
<input type="date">
```


This is now **clean enough to live in a serious GitHub repo** without future-you cringing when you open it again.
